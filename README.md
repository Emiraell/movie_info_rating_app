Movie Details and Rating App 🎦🍿

This app is a movie details and rating platform that I built from scratch using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux, custom hooks, Material-UI, and The Movie Database (TMDb) as the API backend.

Features:
👉 Browse Movies: Search a vast library of movies sourced from TMDb.

👉 Search functionality: Use the search bar to find specific movies.

👉 Movie Details: View detailed information about each film, including synopsis, ratings, release date, and more.

👉 Rating System: Rate movies and see your ratings.

👉 Custom Hooks: Use custom hooks to efficiently manage states and encapsulate logic.

👉 Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS and responsive design principles provide a seamless experience across multiple devices.

👉 Material-UI Integration: Use pre-built Material-UI components to create consistent, visually appealing UI elements.

Technology Used:

- React Js: A frontend library for creating user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript, which improves code quality and developer productivity.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid user interface development.
- Redux: A state management library for consistent state changes throughout the app.
- Material-UI: React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
- The Movie Database (TMDb): A comprehensive movie and TV database that offers rich movie data through an API.
